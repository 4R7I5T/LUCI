# LUCI
Lifetime Upgradeable Computer Interface is designed to provide a blendshape model that allows for an avatar to have lips animated and speak
from an AI engine such as my GPT-2-Speech-Output repo. I built her upon noticing that most commercial AI does not have any "face" associated to it, just a brand or a new product line. My logic with Luci is that if the Mona Lisa can look the same for 500+ years, an AI should have no problem doing the same (Obviously with graphical improvements - looking at you Lara Croft) Now, philosophy aside, enjoy.

#How To Animate Her Lips & Sync With .wav Files 

Below is a software called Lipsync Pro - there is also a free version as far as I can tell but I was unable to find it in the asset store - I purchased this for $35 and found it worked great bridging the gap between GPT-2 and the lip movements needed to make her seem "real"
